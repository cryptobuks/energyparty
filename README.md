# Energyparty integration/staging tree

Copyright (c) 2018-Present Energyparty Developers. All rights reserved.

This repository contains a number of scripts (the "program") for Energyparty installation.
For more details: see the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/energyparty/energyparty/blob/master/installation.md).

This program is experimental, and some aspects may not work correctly or as expected. Use it at your own risk.

This program is primarily for developers who want to contribute to the Energyparty development. It should not be used directly in production, especially as extra measures are needed to secure the server.
